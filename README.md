# Swiss Demonyms
A table of some less-available information about Swiss municipalities, most importantly Demonym (e.g. Zürich -> Zürcher), neighbourhoods, and neighbouring municipalities. These information may be useful and convenient to have in one place for various NLP- and HLT-related tasks.  

The information are extracted from Wikipedia, where demonyms are non-existent for most municipalities. I added a few more automatically based on some human-extracted rules on existing ones. These demonyms are prefixed with _(?)_. Feel free to create PRs to add missing demonyms or verifying the auto-extracted ones, in case you know them.  

The order of the municipalities is a breadth-first search starting from Eglisau am Rhein, Canton Zürich.
